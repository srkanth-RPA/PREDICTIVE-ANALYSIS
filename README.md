#DESCRIPTION: 
BUILD A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL (E.G.,REGRESSION OR CLASSIFICATION) TOPREDICT OUTCOMES BASED ON A DATASET.

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict outcomes based on structured data. It includes data preprocessing, training, testing, evaluation, and visualization.
‚úÖ Features
1)Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)
  -Supervised learning with multiple models:
      -Logistic Regression
      -Decision Tree
      -Random Forest
      -Gradient Boosting Classifier
  -Model evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
  -Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
  -Feature importance plotting

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
1)Python
2)Pandas, NumPy
3)scikit-learn
4)Seaborn, Matplotlib

üìà Results
Trained and evaluated Gradient Boosting and other classifiers
Achieved high accuracy with feature importance visualization
